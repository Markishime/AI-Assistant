# Oil Palm Nutrition Basics

## Essential Macronutrients

### Nitrogen (N)
- Critical for vegetative growth and leaf development
- Deficiency symptoms: Yellowing of older leaves, reduced growth
- Soil optimal range: 0.2-0.3%
- Leaf optimal range: 2.6-2.9%

### Phosphorus (P)
- Important for root development and fruit production
- Enhances flowering and fruit set
- Soil optimal range: 15-20 ppm
- Leaf optimal range: 0.16-0.19%

### Potassium (K)
- Essential for drought resistance and disease resistance
- Important for fruit quality and oil content
- Soil optimal range: 0.3-0.5 cmol/kg
- Leaf optimal range: 1.0-1.3%

## Secondary Nutrients

### Magnesium (Mg)
- Central component of chlorophyll molecule
- Essential for photosynthesis
- Soil optimal range: 0.3-0.4 cmol/kg
- Leaf optimal range: 0.3-0.45%

### Calcium (Ca)
- Important for cell wall development and root growth
- Soil optimal range: 2-5 cmol/kg
- Leaf optimal range: 0.5-0.7%

## Micronutrients

### Boron (B)
- Important for cell division and reproductive development
- Soil optimal range: 0.5-1 ppm
- Leaf optimal range: 15-25 ppm

### Zinc (Zn)
- Essential for enzyme activities and protein synthesis
- Soil optimal range: 1-3 ppm
- Leaf optimal range: 15-20 ppm

## Soil pH Management
- Optimal pH range: 5.5-6.5
- Below 5.5: Aluminum toxicity risk
- Above 6.5: Reduced micronutrient availability
