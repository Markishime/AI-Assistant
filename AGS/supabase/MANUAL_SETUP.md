# Manual Supabase Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for manually setting up the Supabase database and storage for the Oil Palm AI Assistant.

## Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Account**: Sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **New Project**: Create a new project in your Supabase dashboard
3. **API Keys**: Note down your project URL and API keys

## Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API**
3. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL**: `https://your-project-ref.supabase.co`
   - **anon/public key**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
   - **service_role key**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...` (keep this secret!)

## Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

## Step 3: Database Schema Setup

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Create a new query
4. Copy the contents of `supabase/schema.sql` and paste it
5. Click **Run** to execute the schema

### What this creates:
- **prompts**: Dynamic AI prompts with versioning
- **analysis_reports**: Stored analysis results
- **feedback**: User feedback for improvement
- **reference_documents**: Metadata for RAG documents
- **user_profiles**: Enhanced user profiles
- **admin_logs**: System audit logs

## Step 4: Storage Setup

1. In the SQL Editor, create another new query
2. Copy the contents of `supabase/storage.sql` and paste it
3. Click **Run** to execute the storage configuration

### Storage buckets created:
- **uploads**: Temporary user file uploads (50MB limit)
- **reference-documents**: RAG knowledge base (100MB limit)
- **reports**: Generated PDF reports (10MB limit)

## Step 5: Row Level Security (RLS)

The schema automatically sets up RLS policies for:
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins have full access to all data
- Public read access for reference documents
- Secure file upload/download permissions

## Step 6: Initial Data Seeding

### Add Default Prompts

Go to **Table Editor** > **prompts** and add these records:

**Soil Analysis Prompt:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "title": "Oil Palm Soil Analysis",
  "description": "Comprehensive soil analysis for oil palm cultivation",
  "template": "You are an expert Malaysian oil palm agronomist. Analyze the provided soil data and provide detailed recommendations for optimal palm cultivation.\n\nConsider:\n- Soil pH and nutrient levels\n- Organic matter content\n- Regional climate factors\n- Sustainable practices\n- Malaysian oil palm guidelines\n\nProvide recommendations in JSON format with immediate, short-term, and long-term actions.",
  "sample_type": "soil",
  "language": "en",
  "user_focus": "balanced",
  "is_active": true
}
```

**Leaf Analysis Prompt:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "title": "Oil Palm Leaf Analysis",
  "description": "Comprehensive leaf analysis for oil palm nutrition",
  "template": "You are an expert Malaysian oil palm agronomist. Analyze the provided leaf analysis data and provide detailed nutritional recommendations.\n\nConsider:\n- Nutrient deficiencies and excesses\n- Leaf sampling protocols\n- Fertilizer recommendations\n- Yield optimization\n- Cost-effective solutions\n\nProvide recommendations in JSON format with immediate, short-term, and long-term actions.",
  "sample_type": "leaf",
  "language": "en",
  "user_focus": "balanced",
  "is_active": true
}
```

## Step 7: Test the Setup

### Database Test
1. Go to **Table Editor**
2. Try inserting and querying data in the `prompts` table
3. Check that RLS policies are working correctly

### Storage Test
1. Go to **Storage**
2. Try uploading a test file to the `uploads` bucket
3. Verify the file size and type restrictions work

## Step 8: Upload Reference Documents

1. Go to **Storage** > **reference-documents**
2. Upload your oil palm reference documents:
   - MPOB guidelines
   - Research papers
   - Best practices documents
   - Disease guides

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Check your service role key is correct
   - Verify RLS policies are set up properly

2. **"Function does not exist" errors**
   - Ensure all schema functions were created
   - Check for SQL syntax errors in the setup

3. **Storage upload failures**
   - Verify bucket policies are correct
   - Check file size and type restrictions

4. **Environment variable issues**
   - Ensure all required vars are in `.env.local`
   - Check for typos in variable names

### Manual Verification

Run these queries in SQL Editor to verify setup:

```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('prompts', 'analysis_reports', 'feedback', 'reference_documents', 'user_profiles', 'admin_logs');

-- Check storage buckets
SELECT name, public FROM storage.buckets;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Application**: Upload sample data and run analysis
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check admin_logs for any issues
3. **Optimize Performance**: Add indexes as needed based on usage patterns
4. **Backup Strategy**: Set up regular backups of your database
5. **Security Review**: Regularly audit RLS policies and permissions

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Supabase documentation
2. Review the error logs in your Supabase dashboard
3. Verify your environment variables are correct
4. Test with the automated setup script first
