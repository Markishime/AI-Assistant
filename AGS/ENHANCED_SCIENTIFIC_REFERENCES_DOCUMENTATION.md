- **Visual Confidence Indicators**: Color-coded confidence levels (High/Medium/Low)

### 4. Type System Updates
- **Enhanced AnalysisReport Interface**: Added support for investment levels, implementation steps, sustainability benefits, and cost-benefit analysis
- **Scientific Reference Schema**: Comprehensive interface matching the API response structure
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing code while adding new features

### 5. API Endpoint Improvements

#### Upload Endpoints (`/api/upload`, `/api/upload-enhanced`)
- Updated to use advanced analysis with scientific references
- Automatic scientific reference retrieval based on analysis content
- Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms

#### Analyze Endpoint (`/api/analyze`)
- Complete rewrite to use advanced analysis pipeline
- Integration with scientific references API
- Support for user priorities and preferences

### 6. Testing & Validation
- **Comprehensive Test Script**: `test-scientific-references.js` validates the entire pipeline
- **Multiple Test Cases**: Covers soil pH, nutrient deficiencies, peat management, and precision agriculture
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks response times, relevance scores, and confidence levels

## Technical Implementation

### Scientific Reference Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
// Analysis type specific scoring
if (analysisType === 'soil') {
  if (content.includes('soil') || content.includes('ph') || content.includes('lime')) {
    score += 15;
  }
} else if (analysisType === 'leaf') {
  if (content.includes('leaf') || content.includes('deficiency') || content.includes('frond')) {
    score += 15;
  }
}

// Malaysian-specific content boost
if (content.includes('malaysia') || content.includes('mpob') || content.includes('sarawak')) {
  score += 10;
}

// Recent data boost
if (item.metadata.year >= 2022) {
  score += 5;
}
```

### Enhanced User Experience Features

#### Report Display Enhancements:
1. **Tabbed Interface**: Analysis Results, Scientific References, and Methodology
2. **Enhanced Metrics Dashboard**: Risk level, confidence score, scientific sources, and priority actions
3. **Professional Formatting**: Academic-style citations with proper attribution
4. **Interactive Elements**: Expandable references with detailed findings
5. **Export Functionality**: JSON export with complete analysis and references

#### Scientific Reference Features:
1. **Relevance Scoring**: 0-100% relevance to user's analysis
2. **Confidence Levels**: High/Medium/Low based on data quality and matching
3. **Application Notes**: Specific explanations of how research applies to user's case
4. **Key Findings**: Bullet-pointed highlights from each study
5. **DOI Links**: Direct links to original research papers

## Usage Examples

### For Soil Analysis with Low pH:
- **Relevant Research**: "Optimal soil pH for oil palm is 5.5â€“6.5..."
- **Application**: "The lime application rates and pH management strategies detailed in this study directly address the soil acidity conditions detected in your analysis."
- **Confidence**: High (95% relevance)

### For Leaf Nutrient Deficiency:
- **Relevant Research**: "Nitrogen deficiency in oil palm leaves (below 2.5% dry weight) causes chlorosis..."
- **Application**: "This research provides validated diagnostic criteria and correction protocols directly applicable to the leaf nutrient issues identified in your analysis."
- **Confidence**: High (92% relevance)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
1. **In-Browser PDF Preview**: Direct viewing of research papers
2. **Citation Export**: BibTeX, EndNote, and APA format exports
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by year, journal, confidence level
4. **Personalized Recommendations**: User-specific research suggestions
5. **Collaborative Features**: Share analyses with team members

### Performance Optimizations:
1. **Caching Layer**: Cache frequently accessed research data
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load references on-demand
3. **Pagination**: Handle large result sets efficiently
4. **Search Optimization**: Improve relevance scoring algorithms

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Required:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for GPT-4o

### Database Setup:
